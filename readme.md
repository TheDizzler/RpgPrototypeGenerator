##TODO
>- branches deletable
>- outputs don't update ui when query is deleted
>- updating InputNode inputs should refresh ScenimaticManager editor
>- allow control flow outputs from queries
>- connection points currently only hold reference to guids of connections if it's an output. This is fine for control flows but will need to be changed for variables
>- OutputNode for passing player choices to game
